# GoogleScraper BOT

### How does this work ?
This bot's using the google-play-scraper npm modules to make request  to the store and get informations on the game of your choice.

<hr>

### How to run ?
Before making anything, you need to install and configure [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
Once done, you need to download or clone (using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)) this repository.
After, go in the download path with a terminal and type this command to install all requirements:
> ```sh
> # Will install all external modules contained in package.json
> npm install
> ```
Once it's done, open the file and change the variable ``prefix`` to put your own prefix (by default as ``g?``) and the ``token`` variable by the token of your MP bot.

In a second part, type this command to start the script:
> ```sh
> # Will start the script
> npm start # OR node index.js
> ```

Finally, get on Discord and type this command:
> ``g?scrap your_game_name``

### Level secure:
It's pretty secure. Take care to not making to many requests to the google-play-scraper api, because it can refuse to send you data. So make requests with a secure delay, like 2 or 3 requests per seconds.

### DISCLAIMER:
I'm not held responsible for any potential penalty applied to your account by Discord or an IP ban from Google Play.
